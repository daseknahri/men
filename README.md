# White-Label Restaurant Website

This repo is no longer just a single demo restaurant site.

It is now a seller-oriented white-label restaurant website template with:

- a public website
- a public menu and ordering flow
- a protected admin panel
- multilingual content support for French / English / Arabic
- admin shell i18n for login, seller tools, readiness, and security surfaces
- branding, hero, and media management
- support for multiple homepage hero slide images
- preset-aware branding controls for colors, surfaces, text, and menu mood
- a branding preview that mirrors homepage/menu mood more closely during setup
- preset-specific public styling so each main preset feels more distinct on homepage and menu
- section visibility and ordering controls
- quick-launch presets for new restaurants
- a local menu-image suggestion library for missing dish visuals
- backup export / import for cloning and recovery
- smoke checks for safer deployment work

The current goal is to turn this into a dependable first sellable product that can be reused for many restaurants with minimal code changes.

## Current Product Status

Already working in the codebase:

- server-backed restaurant branding
- server-backed homepage and menu configuration
- admin uploads for logo and hero assets
- admin-managed multi-slide homepage hero media
- preset selection and deeper theme-token editing in the branding form
- neutral starter defaults for branding, WiFi, and seed content
- per-item FR / EN / AR translations for menu items
- section visibility controls
- section ordering controls
- JSON backup export / import
- quick-launch presets
- persisted preset-aware theme tokens for public branding
- local menu-image suggestion rules, confidence-aware matching, and managed placeholder assets
- a starter restaurant seed with managed dish visuals and a managed gallery set, so first-launch demos do not open completely empty
- shared slot-level media audit for branding, gallery, promo, featured, and menu imagery
- stronger homepage/menu spacing and motion polish on the public-facing experience
- rerender-safe staged motion on the menu landing, promo, featured, category, and item flows instead of one-shot paint-only animation
- hashed admin credentials with throttling and security status
- safer public handling for broken URLs and missing images

Still not finished:

- launch-quality media/content pass for the first sellable package
- importer implementation for PDF / image menu ingestion
- internal launcher / AI onboarding tooling
- stronger preset/theme system for different restaurant categories

## Project Structure

- `website-server.js`: serves the public site and public APIs
- `admin-server.js`: serves the admin UI and protected admin APIs
- `site-store.js`: shared storage, normalization, and persistence rules
- `server-common.js`: shared auth/session helpers
- `index.html`: homepage
- `menu.html`: menu / ordering / landing flow
- `admin.html`: admin UI
- `app.js`: homepage behavior
- `menu.js`: menu / ordering / gallery / game behavior
- `admin.js`: admin behavior
- `shared.js`: shared defaults, i18n helpers, browser-state helpers
- `data.json`: persisted restaurant data
- `uploads/`: uploaded assets
- `scripts/smoke-check.js`: lightweight end-to-end sanity test

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run the public website:

```bash
npm run start:website
```

Run the admin:

```bash
ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASS=change-me-now npm run start:admin
```

Default local URLs:

- website: `http://localhost:3002`
- admin: `http://localhost:3102/admin`

## Validation Commands

Run these before deployment or handoff:

```bash
npm run check
npm run smoke
npm run predeploy
```

What they do:

- `npm run check`: syntax-checks the main server and frontend entry files
- `npm run smoke`: boots the public and admin servers on test ports and checks key public/admin routes
- `npm run predeploy`: runs the full local deploy gate before pushing to Coolify

## Security Notes

- Admin auth is server-side and cookie-based.
- Credentials should be changed before delivery.
- The app supports hashed password storage and login throttling.
- With the recommended deployment config, admin credential changes are persisted in `/app/data/auth.json`.
- Once a restaurant changes credentials from the Security tab, that stored auth file takes precedence over the original `ADMIN_USER` / `ADMIN_PASS` environment values.
- The admin security panel should not show the default-credentials warning at handoff time.
- Keep AI keys and future automation credentials out of the live restaurant admin.

## Data And Product Model

This product is currently best treated as:

- one deployable restaurant instance per client
- one shared codebase
- one normalized restaurant data shape

That data shape already covers:

- brand identity
- homepage copy
- contact data
- hours
- payment / facilities
- social links
- gallery
- promotions
- menu items with translations

The future importer and launcher should write into that same normalized shape instead of creating a separate format.

## Recommended Working Mode

For now, the strongest delivery model is:

1. prepare a restaurant instance yourself
2. use presets, uploads, admin tools, and backups to speed up setup
3. deliver the finished site plus admin access
4. let the restaurant use admin for small edits only

Do not put raw AI onboarding or OpenAI credentials directly into the live client admin.

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for the deploy-safe Coolify flow.

## Handoff

See [SELLER_HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md](./SELLER_HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md) before cloning or delivering a restaurant instance.
